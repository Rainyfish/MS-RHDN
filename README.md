Multi-scale Residual Hierarchical Dense Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution

## Slide 
**Multi-scale Residual Hierarchical Dense Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution** is the slide of our method. You can also download it from [Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rainyfish/MS-RHDN/master/multi-scale%20residual%20hierarchical%20dense%20networks%20for%20single%20image%20super-resolution.pptx)

## Super-resultion Results 
Results on Benchmark Datasets for 2,3,4,8 times SR with BI model and $\times3$ SR with BD model can be download from [Results](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vrsl3gipoFXRgO8550pJDw). And the extracted code is "74yt"
